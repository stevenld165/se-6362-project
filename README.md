# se-6362-project

## Project setup

1. Make sure you have Python installed. I am using version 3.11 on my machine, but I think it will be fine as long as you have a modern version installed.
2. Run `py -3 -m venv .venv`
3. Then run `.venv\Scripts\activate` if on Windows, `. .venv/bin/activate` if not.
4. Finally, with the venv enabled, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
